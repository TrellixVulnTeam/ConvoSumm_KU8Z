I would like the get six tally marks and a moon to represent that certain people that changed my life.



Which i dont think anyone would enjoy doing.
I wold like to get something to represent a time in my life that shows who i am.




Tattoos are not all that horrible.
I dont think tattoos are my thing.
I think tattoos are pretty cool.
I believe tattoos are a great way to express yourself.
I really like them
However there are some disadvantages to getting a tattoo.
but I dont think itâ€™s worth
I honestly probably would get a tattoo even if they are very painful.
